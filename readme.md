# **Dream Icons**

## Overview
The **Dream Icons** project is a open repository of lightweight, hand-crafted svg icons for use in applications where clean, modern style and load performance is of paramount importance. All icons come in one of two types: **regular** and **solid**. 

All dream icons are CC0 licensing, which means not only are they copyright-free, but they are attribution free as well. Feel free to use them in whatever project and capacity you'd like, no attribution required! 

Hopefully that's enough to get you started using Dream icons in your next project.

***Happy coding!***
